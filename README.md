# OpenAI

At the moment, this is a [Jupyter notebook]( https://github.com/rwcitek/openai/blob/main/OpenAI.ipynb )
that demonstrated how to use the OpenAI API via Python.
The notebook can be run from within GitHub's CodeSpaces or Google's Colab, and probably other notebook platforms.
Keep in mind you will be using a private API key.
I'm reasonably confident that it will stay private with CodeSpaces and Colab.
I'm not sure about the other platforms.
